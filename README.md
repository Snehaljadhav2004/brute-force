# brute-force
The goal of the "Brute Force Password Cracker" project is to build a tool that demonstrates the vulnerabilities of weak passwords by attempting to crack them through brute force methods. This tool systematically tries every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found. The main goal is to highlight the importance of strong passwords and educate users about the risks of using simple, easily guessable passwords. The project focuses on cybersecurity awareness, showing how brute force attacks work and why robust password practices are crucial for protecting sensitiveÂ information.
